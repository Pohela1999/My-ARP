            <h1>Whai is digital marketing</h1>
            <p>Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels, platforms, and technologies to promote products or services to consumers. Unlike traditional marketing,
                 which relies on physical media like print 
                and broadcast, digital marketing utilizes the internet, social media, search engines, mobile apps, and email to reach audiences.
                 It enables businesses to connect with customers in real-time, measure campaign performance, and personalize communication based on data and user behavior.

                Key components of digital marketing include search engine optimization (SEO), which improves a website’s visibility in search results; pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, where businesses pay for targeted ads; content marketing, which involves creating valuable content to attract and engage users; and social media marketing, which leverages platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

            <h1>How Digital Marketing Works</h1>
            <p>
             Marketing encompasses a wide range of techniques and media that companies can use to promote their products and services to potential consumers and improve their market share. To be successful, it requires a combination of advertising and sales savvy. Professional marketers take on these tasks either internally at individual companies or externally at marketing firms that may serve many different clients.

            Companies once focused on marketing through print, television, and radio because that was all they had. Although those options still exist, the internet gave companies another way to reach consumers and gave rise to digital marketing.The new technologies and trends forced companies to change their marketing strategies and rethink their budgets. Email became a popular marketing tool in the early days of digital marketing. Then the focus shifted to search engines like Netscape, which allowed businesses to tag and keyword items to get themselves noticed. The development of social platforms like Facebook made it possible for companies to track user data and deliver their messages to very specific audiences.Companies once focused on marketing through print, television, and radio because that was all they had.
